			<h1>Biography of Trevor Russo</h1>
		</header>
		<p>I was born on April 17th, 1999 in New York City. We then moved to New Jersey after that because the apartment was too small. I attended Chapin School for elementary and middle school, and then I graduated from there and joined the Peddie School. I became an integral member of the robotics team and I studied Computer Science for 3 years, eventually winning the graduation award for Computer Science. I also began my quest into sports broadcasting. Then I went to Tufts, where I currently study Computer Science and Film and Media Studies as a sophomore. I also do JumboCast, the sports broadcasting club at Tufts, where I commentate and produce content, including my famous broadcast of the Wesleyan-Tufts homecoming match this year. I also was the producer of the Wareham Gatemen this past summer, where I refined the broadcasts and was part of the 2018 Championship Team. 
In terms of what I like to do, I enjoy sleeping, sports and video games.</p>
